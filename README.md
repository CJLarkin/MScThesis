This contains the code used to conduct the GBM genomic data analysis for the project titled "Modelling DNA Damage in the Glioblastoma Tumour Microenvironment."

There is both a python script and an ipython notebook (data generated in ipynb) as well as the data that was used.

All code was written by Collin James Larkin with the exception of the WriteGINML function, which was provided by Clara Pavillet.
